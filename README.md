<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe in React</h1>

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using React, 
allowing two players to play against each other by taking turns to align three identical symbols on a 3x3 game board.

<h2>Features</h2>

    Automatic win detection: The game automatically detects if any of the players have aligned three identical symbols and displays the result (win, draw, or in progress) on the screen.
    Option to restart the game: After the end of a game, players can close the popup and restart the game.
    Player turn tracking: The game displays the current player's turn (PHP or JavaScript) on the screen.</p>
