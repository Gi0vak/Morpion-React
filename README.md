# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using React, allowing two players to play against each other 
by taking turns to align three identical 
symbols on a 3x3 game board.
Features

Interactive user interface: Players can click on the squares to 
place their symbols (PHP or JavaScript) on the game board.
Automatic win detection: The game automatically detects if any 
of the players have aligned three identical symbols and displays the result 
(win, draw, or in    progress) on the screen.
Option to restart the game: After the end of a game, players can 
close the popup and restart the game.
Player turn tracking: The game displays the current player's turn 
(PHP or JavaScript) on the screen.
