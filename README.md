<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe in React</h1>

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using React, 
allowing two players to play against each other by taking turns to align three identical symbols on a 3x3 game board.

<h2>Features</h2>

    Interactive user interface: Players can click on the squares to place their symbols (PHP or JavaScript) on the game board.
    Automatic win detection: The game automatically detects if any of the players have aligned three identical symbols and displays the result (win, draw, or in progress) on the screen.
    Option to restart the game: After the end of a game, players can choose to restart the game by clicking on a reset button.
    Player turn tracking: The game displays the current player's turn (PHP or JavaScript) on the screen.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

    React: a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
    HTML/CSS: for the structure and styling of the user interface.
    JavaScript: for the game logic and interactions with the user interface.
